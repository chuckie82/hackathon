learning powder data

mnist_cnn.py is a simple case of handwriting text recognization script. It is from Keras package. We need to add training data set for the current case. 
If you want to test it, you need to install Theano and Keras. It is better to run it on GPU. 


# Goals
* Classify images from a X-ray powder diffraction as "textured" or "non-textured"
*
